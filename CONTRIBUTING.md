## Contribution Guidelines for ZuneAPI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ZuneAPI! We appreciate the time and effort you're putting into making our project better.

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

* **Fork the repository.** This will create a copy of the ZuneAPI codebase on your own GitHub account.
* **Create a new branch.** This will allow you to work on your changes without affecting the main codebase.
* **Make your changes.** Please make sure your changes are well-tested and documented.
* **Submit a pull request.** Once you're happy with your changes, you can submit a pull request to have them merged into the main codebase.

We follow the Conventional Commits: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ convention for commit messages. Please use this format when writing your commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

where:

* `<type>` is one of the following:
    * `feat`: A new feature
    * `fix`: A bug fix
    * `refactor`: A refactoring
    * `docs`: A documentation change
    * `style`: A style change
    * `test`: A test change
    * `chore`: Other changes that don't fit into the other categories
* `<scope>` is an optional scope for the commit. For example, you could use the scope `database` for changes to the database classes, or `route` for changes to routes.
* `<description>` is a brief description of the change.

We also encourage you to add comments to your code to explain what it's doing and why. This will make it easier for other developers to understand your changes and maintain the codebase.

Once you've submitted a pull request, we'll review it and provide feedback. If you need to make any changes, you can update your branch and push the changes to your fork. Then, you can update your pull request.

Once we're happy with your changes, we'll merge your pull request into the main codebase.

Thank you for your contributions!
