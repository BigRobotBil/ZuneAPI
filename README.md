This project is an ongoing effort to recreate the backend API of the now-defunct Zune music service. Please note that this is a **work in progress** and nowhere ready for production. Zune was a media software and streaming service developed by Microsoft, which was discontinued in ~2011. This project is an attempt to bring back parts of the functionality of the Zune backend API.
